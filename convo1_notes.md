# Notes from Bihall

1) **what? -> Anthony**
  - IP algorithm, determine if a print is already in the database
  - takes in prints taken on smartphones.  
  - Not super high resolution. Want to generalize to all smartphones
  
2) **why? -> Elijah**
  - Important for infield officers
  - People that are caught not going to cooperate
  - Too hard to carry around print scanner, need portable
  - Curently stuff being done at NIST on the topic.  Topic of intrest

3) **How? -> Terrance**
  - SQL database
  - Need to build our dataset by taking photos of students' prints, different lighting and conditions
  - Preprocess -> IP to turn the photos into something usable
  - some sort of classification needed.  Maybe SVM, mayble CNN (but would we have enough data)?
