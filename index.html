	Introduction:
</h2>

<p>
  quiccPrints gives smartphone users the ability to a photo of a thumb and convert
it into a fingerprint image.  We were initially motivated to pursue this project
because of its useful applications to law enforcement.  Many fingerprinting
devices are large and clunky, some even require an outlet.  In-field police
officers, however, often face life-or-death situations where it is out of the
question to be held back by such a device, reguardless of its usefulness.  If
officers could quickly and easily scan fingerprints and check them in a database,
they would be able to check for people's past criminal history without the need
for non-biometric forms of identification.  For simplicity, we designed quiccPrints
to only focus on capturing thumbprints, but we believe that our software could
be easily expanded upon to include other fingers.
</p>
<p>
  Although there have been new, more portable fingerprinting devices created to
satisfy this need, we thought it would be cool to give officers the same ability,
to fingerprint and check for criminals in a database, with only their cellphone.
We were especially drawn to creating this functionality with just a smartphone
because, in the modern day, officers are likely already carrying a smartphone.
Thus, adding this extra functionality to the smartphone gives them one less thing
to carry even if there are already more portable fingerprinting devices.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that was consistantly in the back of our minds throughout the project
was that these fingerprints not only had to be extracted from photos, but extracted
well enough from these photos so that they sould later be checked in a database.
It is important to note that such an assessment of fingerprint quality is often
done by organizations like NIST (the National Institute of Standards and
Technology), so, due to

<h2>
        Future Work:
</h2>

<p>
  Although you likely could collect fingerprints from fingers other than thumbs
with the current software, the software has been optimized to work only with
thumbprints.  If we were given more time, we would like to add this additional
functionality.
</p>

<p>
  Also, as briefly mentioned earlier, we currently have no evaluation metric of
fingerprint quality, and would likely have to consult an outside agency like
NIST to do so.  This would be another importent future step to take because,
although we can often successfully collect thumbprints with the software, we
currently have no understanding of whether the prints would be considered good
or not.
</p>

<p>
  Connected to asessing fingerprint quality, we would ultamately like to give
users the ability to not only take fingerprints from their cellphones, but also
then send the prints to a database to be checked for a match.  This was originally
a key part of our application, but due to the difficulty involved with developing
an iphone app without previous experience and developing a unique fingerprint
extraction algorithm, we faced significant setbacks.
